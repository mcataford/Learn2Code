## Executing code

- __(True/False)__ The __interpreter's console__ is a great way to test short snippets of code.
- __(True/False)__ The console will always print the output of an operation, whereas executing whole scripts will require you to use `print()` to see any output.
- __(Short answer)__ Can you explain how the interpreter executes a script?
- __(Short answer)__ Can you explain what is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
- __(Short answer)__ Can you explain why __comments__ are an important feature of programming languages?

## Variables

- __(True/False)__ Python forces you to declare which datatype your variables belong to.
- __(True/False)__ Once you initialize a variable, you can easily change its datatype.
- __(True/False)__ It is customary to use __spaces__ in variable names.
- __(Short answer)__ What is the difference between __binary operators__ such as `^` and other operators?
- __(Short answer)__ What is the difference of `+` when used on numerical variables and when used on Strings?
- __(Short answer)__ What is a String and how can you recognize it?
- __(Short answer)__ What happens if you attempt to __concatenate__ strings and non-string values?
- __(Programming)__ Use the __interpreter's console__ to convert values between numerical types and String types; what functions will you use to go from integers to Strings? From Strings to fractional numbers?
- __(Programming)__ Use the __interpreter's  console__ to print out a single string that introduces you and makes use of __concatenation__ and __type conversion__ to insert __numerical data__ in the string. _Note: You should not be inserting numbers as strings directly, but instead should use the `str()` function to convert them into strings._

## Functions

- __(True/False)__ Functions are defined using the `define` keyword.
- __(True/False)__ Functions can have as many input parameters as needed.
- __(True/False)__ __Brackets__ signal where a function starts and ends.
- __(Short answer)__ What happens when a function is used in a script?
- __(True/False)__ You cannot use functions inside of other functions.
- __(Programming)__ Write a function that converts __Celsius__ degrees into __Fahrenheit__. Your function should take as __input__ a numerical value representing Celsius degrees and should __print__ the result as part of a sentence.
- __(Programming)__ Write a function that converts __Fahrenheit__ into __Celsius__. You should be able to use both in a chain and get back the original value you put in.
- __(Programming)__ Modify the two functions above so that they make use of the __return__ statement instead of printing output.
- __(Short answer)__ What is the __return statement__ and why is it useful?
