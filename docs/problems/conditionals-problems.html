    <p>Revisit the <a href="https://mcataford.github.io/TalkPythonToMe/problems/basics-problems.html">temperature conversion problem</a> of the last problem set and implement <strong>input validation</strong> for each of your conversion functions. If the value given to your function is below the minimum acceptable value, you should return the lowest converted value possible, and if the value is above the maximum acceptable value, you should return the highest converted value possible. Think of what the bounds of your input should be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using a combination of conditional statements, write a function that <strong>converts</strong> numerical grades to letter grades. Your overall script should use <strong>user input</strong> methods to ask the user for a numerical grade to convert and should print out a sentence in which the original entered grade and the converted garde are embedded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your solution in <em>2.</em> used <strong>composite expressions</strong> as conditions, can you rework if such that only simple expressions are used?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recursion</strong> is the idea that a function can call itself. By modifying the parameters that are provided to the “inside” call, we can modulate how many times a certain function will run.</p>

    <p>For example, we can write the following function:</p>

    <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sum_numbers_between</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">):</span>
   <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">:</span>
     <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">a</span>
   <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
     <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">sum_numbers_between</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>

 <span class="n">my_sum</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sum_numbers_between</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>

 <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">my_sum</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>In this scenario, each call of the function either returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> if the range is only composed of <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> (i.e. if the range has <code class="highlighter-rouge">a == b</code>) or <code class="highlighter-rouge">a + sum_numbers_between(a+1,b)</code>. In the second case, note that <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> is incremented: this ensures that it will at some point satisfy the first condition.</p>

    <p>Using the same idea as the one exposed in the snippet above, build a function that sums up all the <strong>even</strong> numbers between two values <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code> where <code class="highlighter-rouge">a &lt;= b</code>.</p>
