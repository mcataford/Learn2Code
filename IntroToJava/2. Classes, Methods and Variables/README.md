# In this section

In this section, we look at Java basics and learn about classes, methods and variables. We play with our first program, _Hello, World!_ and tweak it to see firsthand a sample of what Java allows us to do.

Look at [ClassesMethodsVariables.md](https://github.com/mcataford/Learning/blob/master/IntroToJava/2.%20Classes%2C%20Methods%20and%20Variables/ClassesMethodsVariables.md) for the long-form lecture material.
