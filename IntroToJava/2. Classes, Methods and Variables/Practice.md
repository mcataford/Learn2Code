# Introduction to Java programming

## Classes, methods and variables - Practice problems

### Hello, World!

In the first section of _Hello, World!_, we discussed the eponymous program.

- __(Short answer)__ Can you name each of the three major parts of the _Hello, World!_ program?
- __(True/False)__ A class's name doesn't have to match the name of the file it is in.
- __(True/False)__ Classes are __optional__ containers, we could write Java programs without them.
- __(True/False)__ Class names can contain spaces.
- __(True/False)__ The __main method__ is the method that is run automatically when a file is executed.
- __(True/False)__ __Methods__ are Java's equivalent of __functions__ in other languages.
- __(True/False)__ You cannot make your own methods in Java.
- __(Short answer)__ What is a __statement__ and what differentiates it from other parts of your program that aren't statements?
- __(Short answer)__ What helps the compiler determine where statements end?
- __(Short answer)__ What helps the compiler determine where code blocks start and end?
- __(Short answer)__ What happens if you forget a semicolon at the end of a statement or an opening or closing brace anywhere in your program?
- __(Short answer)__ Can you write out a basic class declaration and main method?
- __(Programming)__ Following the _Hello, World!_ program as a model, write a small program that will "Hello" and "World" on two different lines instead of one.

### Variables

- __(True/False)__ A __String__ is an example of primitive data type.
- __(True/False)__ Variable names can contain __spaces__.
- __(True/False)__ You can add numerical values to characters (or data of type `char`).
- __(Short Answer)__ What is the difference between a primitive and a reference type?
- __(Short answer)__ What is the difference between __declaration__ and __initialization__?
- __(Short answer)__ What is __concatenation__?
- __(True/False)__ You can use a variable before it is __initialized__.
- __(Programming)__ Write a short program that prints an introductory sentence of the type "Hello, my name is ..." and that makes good use of __concatenation__ to integrate at least one integer value and one fractional (`double`). Your program should __print__ the output to the screen.
- __(Programming)__ Write a short program that converts __Celsius__ degrees to __Fahrenheit__. You can assume that the value to be converted is stored in an `int` variable named `celsius_degrees`. You can use this [stub]() to get started. For a greater challenge, write it out from scratch. __Make sure that you use concatenation to output a sentence containing your result.__
